<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Ryan Marsh is a freelance lighting and sound designer, as well as a hobbyist software developer. 
  His hope is to be able to create versions of the tools tha are commonly used in his field in order 
  to make it freely available or accessible at a minimum cost so that financial constraints are no 
  longer a barrier to design.</p>
